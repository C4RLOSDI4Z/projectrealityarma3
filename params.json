While we are trying to make the entry barrier as low as possible, we will still include the depth and complexity that would be expected from a Project Reality version in Arma 3. The catch phrase 'Easy to learn, hard to master' really shapes the whole project.\r\n\r\nPR:BF2 stands out for it's immersive gameplay and realistic approach on combat. Since A3 does a great job at delivering an authentic combat experience, we'll adjust it's realism settings only to a certain degree. Disabling 3rd Person View, Crosshairs and Map spotting were some of these features but we won't stop here: Removing the ability to focus zoom by holding right-click and adjusting the kits so a regular Rifleman replicates a real-life grunt are already planned\r\n\r\nTo summarize, PRA3 is going to be released as an **open-source framework** that delivers a very compelling, teamplay oriented game mode in Project Reality fashion right off the bat.\r\n\r\n## Core features\r\n\r\n*     AAS Gamemode\r\n*     Custom UI\r\n*     High Performance\r\n*     Logistics System\r\n*     Medical System\r\n*     Marker System\r\n*     Squad Management System\r\n*     Deployment System\r\n*     Kit & Vehicle Restrictions\r\n*     Commander\r\n*     Mod Support\r\n\r\n## Development team\r\n\r\n* Bluedrake42 - Project Manager\r\n* Hoegnison - Development Lead\r\n* jokoho482 - Scripting, Performance\r\n* NetFusion - Scripting, UI\r\n* BadGuy - Scripting, Config, UI\r\n* Mitsu - UI Design & Public Relations\r\n\r\n## Media\r\n\r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RealityArmA)\r\n* [Gameplay footage](https://youtu.be/tD2JjmXZewU?list=PLTCkud8R6jgoOWUkf7ISJGSHp-SpnGiSv)\r\n* [Devblog (Ger)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTCkud8R6jgo4jR-5sx8YP-xTywgXfZc7)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nDiscord : http://discord.me/pra3\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n**PvP or COOP?** Only PvP so far\r\n\r\n**Will there be multiple maps for this?** The base mod will deliver AAS gamemodes for Stratis, Altis and Tanoa. Multiple for each island to be exact.\r\n\r\n**Do I need to download it before playing it?** No, it's a serverside framework that does not need any modificiation of the client. Just join and play.\r\n\r\n**How to play PRA3?** As of now, we're still half way through development, that's why public servers are not available yet. You can join our closed playtest on our discord: http://discord.me/pra3\r\n\r\n**Will there be modded versions?** No official modded versions are planned yet, though we'll are providing mod support for PRA3. PRA3 is meant to be a framework, which can be used with different clientside mods so communities can easily implement their favourite assets. In addition several mod teams have shown interest to support our mod by making a modded version of it. PRA3 + IFA3 / RHS / CUP are totally possible.\r\n\r\n**Is there a custom VoIP system like PR:BF2 has it?** Not at the moment. Since we don't want players to install additional mods in order to play, we'll stick to vanilla VoIP. If we see it's inefficient we will consider writing a VoIP system by ourselves or make TFAR / ACRE versions of the mission.\r\n\r\n**Why should I consider PRA3 instead of TacBF?** TacBF is a great mod, we're big fans of it. Yet the performance and required mods to enjoy it don't allow a smooth experience. Some of the TacBF guys are helping us out on making our iteration of PRA3 a much more smoother experience. Kudos to Adanteh for constructive feedback and critisism.\r\n\r\n**A3 performance in other MP Gamemodes is bad, is it better in PRA3?** Definitely. It's worth mentioning that our framework is built on an unscheduled environment, making the process a lot more efficient and less taxing on the client. Playtests have shown that a 30 Player environment works exceptionally well and frames are very high at this point. On my end with following hardware I get around 60 fps in heavy clashes and 70 in areas with less action. i7 4770k @ 4.0 GHz, R9 280x, 16GB RAM and A3 installed on a Kingston 320 GB SSD.\r\n\r\n**How can I contribute / make feature requests / share my concerns?** We're happy about any kind of constructive feedback and critisism. You can join us on our Discord to talk to us directly or open feature requests on our GitHub Repository\r\n\r\n**Many Gamemodes use monetization for in-game benefits. Will PRA3 have that?** Our clientside mod is licensed as APL-SA or Arma Public License - Share alike. This means that any kind of monetization is forbidden and adaptions have to be released under APL-SA as well. The serverside pbo itself is licensed under CC, which does not allow any kind of distribution if you changed or remixed anything of the code, as well as usage without crediting PRA3 or rereleasing under another license. **We can shut down servers that do not follow these rules.** \r\n",
